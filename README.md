### Hi there 👋

After 9 years managing restaurants in Paris. 
Always passionate about technology, I decided to found my own mobile game studio and more recently reconverted to software development 🧑‍💻
I'm really passionate about web3 and more deeply about the immersive experience via the "metaverse" and everything that goes with it.

Here's my stack: 
- Python 🐍
- C# ✨
-SQL✨
-Html ✨
-CSS✨
Framework : 
-Django 
-Kivy
- Unity 3D
